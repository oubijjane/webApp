a web app to show my skills.

this is a web app for an onlin store demo where you can add products with there price names description and quantity, and accounts for customers and for admins(to change products delete them or even update the same applied on customers accounts)
the frontend is not the best i only used html and css but for the backend I used variety of frameworks: spring boot, hibernate,spring mvc and security, Mysql, maven to deliver this app

please run the sql script in the sql folder to set up the necessary database for the application .

go to src/main/resources/application.properties to set up the database url, username and password 

for the admin account in the app the password is admin123
and the other accounts the password is the same as the first name.
